RG421 is made of a mahogany body and it comes with a thin and sturdy Wizard III maple neck that has great playability. The neck is known to be fast and that is for a reason. The rosewood fretboard with white dot inlay features 24 jumbo frets. The tonal range of the guitar is no joke, full two octaves to play with. The RG421 is fitted with two of Ibanez’s high-output Quantum humbuckers. The passive pickups are controlled by volume and tone control knobs, as well as a selector switch for the pickups. Interestingly enough they went for a fixed bridge hear instead of a tremolo.",

The thin, U-shaped neck has 24 extra-jumbo frets that are all about comfort and speed. The Set-thru neck construction is and quite innovative. The neck is glued to the body and this makes access to the upper frets and the neck-to-body transition much smoother. The finish is flawless the frets have no sharp edges and are polished to be smooth as possible. The locking nut and Floyd Rose bridge are doing their job perfectly, you can push the intonation to the limits. The guitar sounds perfectly balanced especially when distorted. The guitar is equipped with two Seymour Duncan Pickups, a Hot Rails humbucker in the neck position, and a Pegasus humbucker in the bridge position. These two are controlled by a 3-way pickup switch and there is also a coil tap function that you can activate by pulling the tone knob.",
